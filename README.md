This RGB LED driver built around an ESP32 comes with 5 P channel Mosfets and a 3.3V LDO voltage regulator.
Controlling the ESP32 is possible from web paged hosted on the ESP32. With it's 5 Mosfets, this module can control everything that needs switching 5 high sink loads (up to 5 Amps), but this board has been specifically design for the 3 R, G and B channels, with the 2 other channels remaining for white strip LEDs.

# Key features
- **ESP32 C3** supermini devboard based
- Input voltage from **6 to 24V** (recommended)
- L7805AB **5.0V LDO voltage regulator**
- **x5 P-channel MOSFETs** (AO3400)
- **x2 8P FPCs** and **2.54mm Header** for accessing IOs including I²C lines.
