# RGB_connect: An ESP32 powered RGB LED driver with 5 channels:

This RGB LED driver built around an ESP32 comes with 5 P channel Mosfets and a 3.3V LDO voltage regulator.
Controlling the ESP32 is possible from web paged hosted on the ESP32. With it's 5 Mosfets, this module can control everything that needs switching 5 high sink loads (up to 5 Amps), but this board has been specifically design for the 3 R, G and B channels, with the 2 other channels remaining for white LED strips.
